Hot or Not: CATS
----------------
How it works:

Objects are created from 14 different cat photos and the number of votes they've accumulated.

Using a shuffle function, an array containing the 14 objects is shuffled and 2 objects are chosen to be display to the web page.

The user selects one cat or the other cat.

A polar area chart is used to visualize the amount of votes each cat has, showing the most popular cat of all.
